## Distance measurement system

* This project is on distance measurement system using ultrasonic sensor. This system provides an efficient way on 

    measuring small distances precisely without any actual contact with the physical world. 

    It is used in several applications like automobile to assist in car-parking or anti-collision systems and in measuring

    liquid level and many more.

    __*Future Scope*__  of this project could be Obstacle avoidance vehicle/robot, this obstacle avoidance robot is based 

    on the principle of ultrasonic sensor as well. The basic principle of ultrasonic sensor based on the principle of echo

    . When sound waves are transmitted in the environment by the ultrasonic sensor then waves return back to the origin 

    as echo after striking on the obstacle in its path.
